    "text": "Introduction\n\nMotivation\nI chose to conduct this Final Project on the impact of gender. I am a woman in STEM who has always been outnumbered in the technical classes that I have taken. I think it is essential for all people - regardless of their gender, race, nor any other distinguishing factors to be treated as equal. One of the largest comments I have always faced is that my gender does has not made a difference - and the struggles I have seen in my journey so far and what I have been able to overcome are not real. I wanted to dedicate this project to all underrepresented people who have felt their journeys have been undermined.\n\n\nQuestion\nHence, the focus on my project is exploring the question:\nDoes gender still play a role in achieving and navigating educational, and professional opportunities?\n\n\nOverview\nI wanted to explore multiple sides to this question which means focusing on the educational disparities in gender, professional disparities, and also tackling the question of time with the usage of the word still in my research question. Additionally, I wanted to understand whether this is specific to any country / region. Some of the sub-questions I wish to explore with my analysis include:\n\nWhat does professional representation look like by gender in popular jobs?\nHow are men/women involved with out of work activities like care without pay?\nWhat does comfort in the workplace look like by gender?\nIs there any pay discrepancy between the genders?\nWhat is the difference in education recieved by men and women?\n\nI aim to not only support and answer these sub-questions and my main question with data visualizations, but also external research and sources to ensure I am recieving a well rounded grasp of the context of the data I explore.\n\n\nSources and Data\n\nEach of the sources are linked in the visualization prior to using them\n\nI discovered my data by searching up csv files that include some sort of content regarding gender in the professional / education field. I made sure to supplement my data discovered through visualizations with some articles/research to ensure that my data is truly capturing the full story.\nHere are the references to the supplementary articles:\nEuropean Women’s Lobby. “Women in Politics.” Accessed July 31, 2024. https://www.womenlobby.org/Women-in-Politics-507?lang=en.\nTal, Orlee. “Council Post: What I’ve Learned as a Female CEO in a Male-Dominated Industry.” Forbes.

    "text": "Methods of Research\n\nProfessional Representation by Gender\nI will start by comparing professional representation by gender and examining the M:F ratio in some popular jobs. I scoured the internet for potential data sources that may display this. I seek to partially answer the sub-question: What does professional representation look like by gender in popular jobs?\nHere is a site I found that accomplishes this: https://data.gov.ie/dataset/gender-breakdown-by-grade-within-grade-stream/resource/f78cefe7-7170-4184-b21d-4bee89e2c13f\nThis bar plot fully displays the male to female ratio for each of these roles so that we can understand which jobs are more popular for each gender.\n\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np\n\n#Load dataset into pandas DataFrame and convert Percentages into floats\ndf = pd.read_csv(\"gender_by_profession.csv\")\ndf['Percentage of Females in Grade'] = df['Percentage of Females in Grade'].str.rstrip('%').astype(float)\ndf['Percentage of Males in Grade'] = df['Percentage of Males in Grade'].str.rstrip('%').astype(float)\n\n#Figure, axis, y-axis labels and indices\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(14, 12))\ny_labels = df['Grade ']\ny = np.arange(len(df))\n\n#Plot horizontal bars\nax.barh(y, df['Percentage of Females in Grade'], height=0.4, label='Females', color='skyblue')\nax.barh(y, df['Percentage of Males in Grade'], height=0.4, left=df['Percentage of Females in Grade'], label='Males', color='salmon')\n\nax.set_yticks(y)\nax.set_yticklabels(y_labels, rotation=0)\nax.set_xlabel('Percentage')\nax.set_title('Gender Ratio per Role')\nax.legend()\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis data essentially provides some insight into the gender dynamics within specific fields, and helps uncover patterns of occupational segregation / gender-based disparities. Some observations we can make is that there are 39 roles for Male-dominated jobs, and out of these 27 roles are entirely male represented. The 27 roles with near-complete male dominance include Secretarial and Advisory roles, Technical and Engineering Fields, Meterological Services, and Auditing and Inspection. This indicates a severe gender imbalance and reflects historical trends where roles involving technical expertise / high-stakes decision making are typically entirely male dominated. Contrastingly out of the 16 roles that are Female-dominated, the 9 that are entirely female are Assistant, Cleaning, Secretary, Librarian. Outliers here include Administrative Officer and Architect, but they are outweighed by the other roles which are typically considered “supportive roles.” Roles of domestic work (cleaning), and other typically lower wage jobs are traditionally occupied by women as demonstrated here. This data shows a clear disparity between the rigor, level, and economic status of the jobs typically performed by men and women indicating more progress necessary in advancing the status of work-place equality.\n\n\nUnpaid Care Work Female-Male Ratio\nNow let’s analyze how much care work men/women do on average to understand where they may be spending their time other than work. This is to see how much women/men work in terms of unpaid labor. I seek to answer the sub-question: How are men/women involved with out of work activities like care without pay?\nI found this dataset to work through this: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/imtkaggleteam/womens-right\n\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\nfile_path = 'unpaid_work.csv' \ndata = pd.read_csv(file_path)\n\n#Sort data by female-male ratio of time devoted to unpaid care work\nsorted_data = data.sort_values(by='Female to male ratio of time devoted to unpaid care work (OECD (2014))', ascending=False)\n\n#Select and extract ratios & 15 country names for highest female-male ratios\ntop_countries = sorted_data.head(15)\ntop_ratios = top_countries['Female to male ratio of time devoted to unpaid care work (OECD (2014))']\ntop_entities = top_countries['Entity']\n\n# Create pie chart to visualize distribution of ratios among top 15 countries\nplt.figure(figsize=(12, 8))\nplt.pie(top_ratios, labels=top_entities, autopct='%1.1f%%', startangle=140)\nplt.title('Top 15 Countries by Female to Male Ratio of Unpaid Care Work (2014)\\n\\n')\nplt.axis('equal')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis chart depicts the female to male ratio of unpaid care work in the top 15 countries for 2014. While dated, it reveals a global gender imbalance in the distribution of unpaid labor. In countries like Mali, women contribute 17.3% of the unpaid care work, which alludes to a large burden on women with far-reaching implications. These high percentages suggest that women in the top 15 regions are dedicating a massive portion of their time to caregiving responsibilities, which can limit their participation in paid employment, educational pursuits, and other personal development opportunities. Contrastingly, men who do not have to dedicate their time towards this, can explore these opportunities and continue to grow. Further, this gender disparity in unpaid care work perpetuates a cycle of economic dependency and limits women’s financial independence. In countries like Pakistan (10.2%) and India (9.8%), the heavy load of unpaid care work on women reflects deep-rooted cultural norms and systemic barriers that reinforce traditional gender roles. Women here can find it challenging to pursue careers or engage in economic ventures furthering the gap that exists. Even in countries with lower percentages like Portugal (4.2%), and Cambodia (4.0%), women are always performing more unpaid care work. This imbalance is clearly visible across the world, and addressing it is essential to empower women to be able to fully participate in the economic sector of society rather than being restricted by other duties that men do not share.\n\n\nComfort and Safety in the Workplace by Gender\nNow let’s analyze actual employee survey data to gain an understanding of how real employees of both genders truly feel about their jobs and employment. This dataset is based upon a City of Tempe survey in 2018. I seek to answer the sub-question: What does comfort in the workplace look like by gender?\nHere is the dataset: https://data.world/city-of-tempe/053e6c31-6d76-46f4-b0b8-7ab10e466387https://data.world/city-of-tempe/053e6c31-6d76-46f4-b0b8-7ab10e466387\n\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\n\nfile_path = 'employee_survey_data.csv'\ndf = pd.read_csv(file_path)\n\n#Select columns that choose gender and the keyword 'safe and comfortable'\ngender_columns = [col for col in df.columns if 'gender' in col.lower()]\ncomfort_columns = [col for col in df.columns if 'safe and comfortable' in col.lower()]\n\n#If more than one, select the first one\ngender_column = gender_columns[0] if gender_columns else None\ncomfort_column = comfort_columns[0] if comfort_columns else None\n\n#Remove any rows that have missing values in either column\nfiltered_df = df.dropna(subset=[gender_column, comfort_column])\n\n#Extract gender values and only take male and female \nunique_genders = filtered_df[gender_column].unique()[:2]\ngender_mapping = {unique_genders[0]: 'Female', unique_genders[1]: 'Male'}\nfiltered_df['Gender Mapped'] = filtered_df[gender_column].map(gender_mapping)\n\n#Create a boxplot to visualize distribution of comfort and safety scores by gender\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))\nsns.boxplot(data=filtered_df, x='Gender Mapped', y=comfort_column, hue='Gender Mapped', palette='viridis')\nplt.title('Distribution of Comfort and Safety Felt at Work by Gender')\nplt.xlabel('Gender')\nplt.ylabel('Comfort and Safety Score')\nplt.xticks(rotation=45)\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis box plot allows us to gain a comprehensive understanding of what exactly is felt by each of the genders in the workplace. Additionally, we can understand the spread of female / male emotions rather than examining an average to truly capture all the data including outliers. The key findings show that females on average feel less comfortable and safe at work compared to their male colleagues. The median comfort and safety score for Women is 4 while Males is 5. Hence, on average it can be determined that men have a more comfortable experience in the work environment. The IQR range (middle 50% of scores) is slightly broader for Males indicating more variance in experiences of safety versus discomfort. For females, this range is more concentrated around the lower median which highlights a constant issue with workplace comfort and safety. Examining outliers can also show that there are some individuals with unusually low scores - likely due to harassment, explicit discrimination, or other adverse circumstances - but also some individuals with high scores for both Men and Women. Generally, the observed disparity in feelings of safety and comfort can lead to lower job satisfaction, higher stress, and decreased productivity in women, and can explain lower career progression/retention rates. They may choose to leave such jobs or avoid some industries altogether.\n\n\nWomen in Leadership\nWe can start with preliminarily exploring what opportunity looks like for Women in leadership roles. To evaluate this, we will explore two datasets - one for US Senate Positions occupied, and one for CEOs. I aim to complete the answer to the sub-question: What does professional representation look like by gender in popular jobs?\nThese datasets are sourced from: https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/fact-sheet/the-data-on-women-leaders/\n\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\n\n#Convert percentages to floats\ndf = pd.read_csv('ceo_women.csv')\ndf['Share of CEOs who are women'] = df['Share of CEOs who are women'].str.rstrip('%').astype(float)\n\nsns.set(style=\"whitegrid\")\n\n#Create a line plot that visualizes the trend of Women CEOs overtime\nplt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))\nsns.lineplot(data=df, x='Year', y='Share of CEOs who are women', marker='o', color='teal', linewidth=2)\nplt.title('Women CEOs Overtime', fontsize=16)\nplt.xlabel('Year', fontsize=12)\nplt.ylabel('Women CEOs (%)', fontsize=12)\n\nplt.grid(visible=True, which='both', linestyle='--', linewidth=0.5)\n\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\n\n#Convert percentages to floats\ndf = pd.read_csv('senate_women.csv')\ndf['Women in Senate'] = df['Women in Senate'].str.rstrip('%').astype(float)\n\nsns.set(style=\"whitegrid\")\n\n#Create a line plot that visualizes the trend of Women Senators overtime\nplt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))\nsns.lineplot(data=df, x='Year', y='Women in Senate', marker='o', color='pink', linewidth=2)\nplt.title('Women Senators Overtime', fontsize=16)\nplt.xlabel('Year', fontsize=12)\nplt.ylabel('Female Senators (%)', fontsize=12)\n\nplt.grid(visible=True, which='both', linestyle='--', linewidth=0.5)\n\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow lets see how much growth happens from year to year in terms of the percent increase in the women in leadership positions to understand where exactly they stand.\n\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\n\nsenate_df = pd.read_csv('senate_women.csv')\nceo_df = pd.read_csv('ceo_women.csv')\n\nsenate_df['Women in Senate'] = senate_df['Women in Senate'].str.rstrip('%').astype(float)\nceo_df['Share of CEOs who are women'] = ceo_df['Share of CEOs who are women'].str.rstrip('%').astype(float)\n\n#Calculate yearly percentage growth for women in both categories\nsenate_df['Senate Growth (%)'] = senate_df['Women in Senate'].diff().fillna(0)\nceo_df['CEO Growth (%)'] = ceo_df['Share of CEOs who are women'].diff().fillna(0)\n\n#Merge the two DataFrames on the Year column\ncombined_df = pd.merge(senate_df[['Year', 'Senate Growth (%)']], ceo_df[['Year', 'CEO Growth (%)']], on='Year')\n\nsns.set(style=\"whitegrid\")\n\n#Plot the Leadership growth Data\nplt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))\nsns.lineplot(data=combined_df, x='Year', y='Senate Growth (%)', marker='o', color='pink', linewidth=2, label='Women in Senate Growth')\nsns.lineplot(data=combined_df, x='Year', y='CEO Growth (%)', marker='o', color='teal', linewidth=2, label='Women CEOs Growth')\nplt.title('Yearly Percent Growth of Women in Leadership', fontsize=16)\nplt.xlabel('Year', fontsize=12)\nplt.ylabel('Percent Growth (%)', fontsize=12)\nplt.grid(visible=True, which='both', linestyle='--', linewidth=0.5)\nplt.legend(loc='upper left')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese charts illustrate a troubling but somewhat encouraging narrative about women’s representation in leadership roles. While we observed persistent underrepresentation in the low initial percentages of women CEOs and senators, there is a slight upward trend. This upward trend has only managed to increase women CEOs to a mere 10% and women senators to 25%. Both of these are far under the goal of 50% in an equally led society. Growth in the growth percentage of both is there, but at times there is a decrease in the amount of percentage. Additionally, the growth rates show variability meaning that the progress is largely inconsistent and slow. Women CEO growth is not as constant as Women Senator growth - reflecting the corporate world and its ever changing nature - however it is surprising to see such less women in power. Growth in Women Senators is happening slowly but started earlier, indicating the appearance of political change prior to business change. It’s important to gain perspective on both Governmental and Corporate leadership roles as they serve as two focal points for a country, but can have different nuances to them.\nAs I examined information from other sources like the European Women’s Lobby, I noticed this data is replicated in other countries with “the current European Parliament consist[ing] of 63%. men,” and “Across the EU, 85% of mayors are men.” Additionally, the source elaborated on why politics may be selling women short with top reasons being confidence, lack of candidate selection (women are not elected), culture (sexism is rampant), lack of funding (women receive less funding than male counterparts), and finally childcare. All of these reasons are devastating, and as observed earlier, unpaid care - childcare in this situation - continues to hinder women’s careers as men do not share these duties. On the other side, we see some of the same generalizations and stereotypes being made by Women CEOs towards their own, with Forbes article by Orlee Tal stating, “calm authoritativeness that women leaders often bring, especially when compared to some men who talk loudly and at length,” when describing why employees flourish under women leadership. While the intent of such statements is positive, and meant to be uplifting, it could be that the same generalizations meant to explain why a woman is an excellent leader (calm versus talkative), could then be re-molded and used for why she is incapable (quiet versus assertive). Thus, it remains best to leave the biases and stereotypes and judge each individual on their own scale rather than their gender.\n\n\nThe Wage Gap across the World\nNext, lets examine the wage gap across the United States. This will allow us to have a better understanding of how women and men are paid for the same work. I aim to answer the sub-question: Is there any pay discrepancy between the genders?\nHere is the source that provided me with this data: https://nwlc.org/resource/wage-gap-state-women-overall/#\n\nimport pandas as pd\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n#Clean payment column by removing $ and , in the column and then converting to float\ndata = pd.read_csv('gender_pay_gap.csv')\ndata['Full-Time Payment for Women/ Dollar Man Makes'] = data['Full-Time Payment for Women/ Dollar Man Makes'].replace('[\\$,]', '', regex=True).astype(float)\ndata['Part-Time Payment for Women/ Dollar Man Makes'] = data['Part-Time Payment for Women/ Dollar Man Makes'].replace('[\\$,]', '', regex=True).astype(float)\n\n#Reshape the DataFrame to a long format that we can then plot\ndata_melted = data.melt(id_vars='State', \n                        value_vars=['Full-Time Payment for Women/ Dollar Man Makes', 'Part-Time Payment for Women/ Dollar Man Makes'],\n                        var_name='Payment Type', \n                        value_name='Ratio')\n\n#General Plotting with Seaborn for style\nsns.set(style='whitegrid')\nplt.figure(figsize=(14, 8))\nax = sns.barplot(x='State', y='Ratio', hue='Payment Type', data=data_melted, palette='viridis')\n\nax.set_ylim(0, 1)\nax.set_xticks(ax.get_xticks())\nax.set_xticklabels(ax.get_xticklabels(), rotation=90)\n\nplt.title('Comparison of Payment Ratios for Women vs. Men by State')\nplt.xlabel('State')\nplt.ylabel('Payment Ratio')\n\nplt.legend(title='Payment Type', bbox_to_anchor=(1.05, 1), loc='upper left')\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis chart and output allows exploration on the wage gap by the state across the United States and sheds light on how much a woman is deprived of compared to a man’s dollar. California is one of the “fairest,” averaging around 0.86, and Utah one of the “least fair,” averaging 0.76 for full-time roles. This positions California as one of the more equitable states in terms of the disparity. Part time roles are paid drastically even lower with a max outlier of 0.86 from District of Columbia, and a low of 0.60 in Utah. It is unacceptable for a woman to be paid 0.60 for a man’s dollar - for doing exactly the same amount of work - and highlights an extreme level of wage inequality. This wage gap further explains the disparity between men and women professionally - alluding to the idea that women’s work is unessential and undervalued as opposed to men. This can also explain why women may choose to participate less in certain fields that further exacerbate this difference in pay. The need to rectify these inequalities across different states continues to remain prevalent.\nAs noticed in research by the Pew Research Center analysis of median hourly earnings of both full- and part-time workers, “women as a whole continue to be overrepresented in lower-paying occupations relative to their share of the workforce. This may contribute to gender differences in pay.” Women are prioritizing their families and working in jobs that pay less due to knowing that they will be “treated differently by employers.” When it comes to raising a family as well, “research has shown that being a mother can reduce women’s earnings, while fatherhood can increase men’s earnings.” So even though women may be the bearers of higher unpaid care time at home (based on previous data analysis), they do not reap the benefits of their work. Overall, women are constantly undervalued in the workforce with their time and efforts not being compensated the same as men.\n\n\nEducation Levels by Gender\nIt is time to examine average educational progress for both men and women. This will allow us to gain a key understanding of what has happened from an educational standpoint. I aim to partially answer the sub-question: What is the difference in education recieved by men and women?\nHere is the source from which I gathered this data: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/noriuk/us-educational-attainment-19952015?select=1995_2015.csv\n\nimport pandas as pd\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\ndf = pd.read_csv('educational_attainment.csv')\n\n#Reshape the DataFrame from wide to long using melt\ndf_melted = df.melt(id_vars=['Year', 'Age_Range', 'Sex'], \n                    value_vars=['No_HS_Diploma', 'HS_Diploma', 'Some_College_No_Degree', 'Associate', 'Bachelor', 'Advanced'],\n                    var_name='Education', \n                    value_name='Count')\n\n#Filter out rows where 'Sex' is both because we only want Male and Female\ndf_filtered = df_melted[df_melted['Sex'] != 'Both']\ndf_agg = df_filtered.groupby(['Sex', 'Education'])['Count'].sum().reset_index()\n#Revert to wide format\ndf_pivot = df_agg.pivot_table(index='Sex', columns='Education', values='Count', fill_value=0)\nax = df_pivot.plot(kind='bar', stacked=True, figsize=(12, 8), colormap='tab20')\n\n#Plot stacked bar chart\nplt.title('Educational Attainment by Sex')\nplt.xlabel('Sex')\nplt.ylabel('Count')\nplt.xticks(rotation=0)\nplt.legend(title='Education Level')\nplt.tight_layout()\n\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe data presented by the chart and in this table showcases the percentages of educational attainment by sex across various levels of education, providing insight into gender disparities in education and their implications on workplace dynamics. The table shows a surprising result - the percentage of males and females achieving Advanced education is only a 2.5% gap from each other - displaying how females are ranked in their degrees even though they may not be in the workforce. Meanwhile, males appear to have a higher percentage in categories such as No_HS_Diploma (58.16% vs. 41.84%) and HS_Diploma (53.98% vs. 46.02%), suggesting that while more females are advancing into higher education, a significant number of males are still remaining at the high school level. This educational pattern, where women are more likely to attain higher education degrees yet men predominate the workforce at lower educational levels, shows societal trends in the disparity between women and men. Despite women’s higher educational attainment, they are still being underrepresented in high-ranking positions in the industry. This disconnect between educational attainment and occupational status alludes to the same structural barriers that impede women’s career progression, like implicit biases, unequal opportunities, and the glass ceiling effect (where women are capped at a certain position). These barriers contribute to a persistent gender gap in leadership and decision-making roles, despite the fact that women are often as, or more, educated than their male counterparts. This data showcases a nuanced interaction between education and gender in the workplace, highlighting the need for policies and initiatives that not only support women’s educational pursuits but also to address the challenges that block women from translating their academic successes into career advances.\n\n\nEarly Performance and Attendance by Gender\nFinally, we will examine a performance dataset of multiple young students. This is to examine how Male and Female students perform in school (prior to adulthood) as compared to their gender, and will aid us in determining which on average do better. I aim to completely answer the sub-question: What is the difference in education recieved by men and women?\nHere is the dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rabieelkharoua/students-performance-dataset\n\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\n\ndf = pd.read_csv('student_performance_data.csv')\n\n#Map the values to the Gender - calculate mean GPA and mean Absences for each one\ndf['Gender'] = df['Gender'].map({0: 'Male', 1: 'Female'})\ngpa_by_gender = df.groupby('Gender')['GPA'].mean().reset_index()\nabsences_by_gender = df.groupby('Gender')['Absences'].mean().reset_index()\n\nplt.figure(figsize=(14, 6))\nsns.set_theme(style=\"whitegrid\")\n\n#Plotting subplot for GPA\nplt.subplot(1, 2, 1)\nsns.barplot(\n    x='Gender',\n    y='GPA',\n    data=gpa_by_gender,\n    hue='Gender',\n    palette='pastel',\n    edgecolor=\".6\"\n)\nplt.title('Average GPA by Gender', fontsize=16)\nplt.xlabel('Gender', fontsize=14)\nplt.ylabel('Average GPA', fontsize=14)\nplt.xticks(fontsize=12)\nplt.yticks(fontsize=12)\n\n#Plotting subplot for Absences\nplt.subplot(1, 2, 2)\nsns.barplot(\n    x='Gender',\n    y='Absences',\n    data=absences_by_gender,\n    hue='Gender',\n    palette='pastel',\n    edgecolor=\".6\"\n)\nplt.title('Average Absences by Gender', fontsize=16)\nplt.xlabel('Gender', fontsize=14)\nplt.ylabel('Average Absences', fontsize=14)\nplt.xticks(fontsize=12)\nplt.yticks(fontsize=12)\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis visualization allows us to fully understand the distribution of GPA by gender, as well as the school absences by gender. This way we can see how different genders potentially perform in school - which gives an outlook on what educational differences look like at an early age prior to external influences. In this dataset, female students on average have a much higher GPA than males while both share around the same absences. Absences correlate to how much effort a student makes in coming to classes and attending school - so boys and girls are largely making the same efforts. On the other hand, the higher GPA for the female student indicates more skill at the concepts conveyed in class - but can also point to heightened focus, understanding of material, or time spent outside of class learning. Once again, we see this higher GPA is not reflected in the workplace through higher posts. As the students age, they become more exposed to external factors like sexism, biases, stereotypes on how each gender traditionally behaves, connotations on which jobs are meant for different genders, and more. Therefore, it is not surprising to see that while female students sometimes outperform male ones, they generally only do so prior to entering industry (in school) while they are still shielded from the harsher wrongful criticism they face in the future.\nIn Lisa Damour’s article “Why Girls Beat Boys at School and Lose to Them at the Office,” for the New York Times, she discusses how “a shortage of competence is less likely to be an obstacle than a shortage of confidence.” This very notion is what allows young girls in school who haven’t yet been exposed to the realities of the workplace to exceed their male peers academically. She also details that the “confidence gap is hardly the only thing keeping women out of top jobs. Women also face gender bias, sexual harassment, and powerful structural barriers in the workplace.” This supplements the findings we have made throughout conducting this research, culminating in the idea that gender bias plays an active role in hindering professional progress."

    "text": "Analysis\nIn this section we will apply our learnings from the 7 data visualizations and supplemental sources explored, and delve into how they connect to the focal question: Does gender still play a role in achieving and navigating educational, and professional opportunities?\nThe question of whether gender still plays a role in educational and professional opportunities is complex. While significant progress towards gender equality in recent decades has been made, the data I discussed reveals how gender continues to be a key factor in shaping experiences and outcomes across Professional and Educational pursuits.\nFrom an educational standpoint, the encouraging findings from the data include the narrowing gap in educational attainment between men and women. Women are achieving higher levels of education at rates comparable to or even surpassing men in many ways. The data indicates that there is only a 2.5% gap between males and females in advanced education degrees. Hence, gender doesn’t necessarily hinder progress in education. This suggests that access to education and the ability to attain academic qualifications have improved for women, reflecting positive societal changes in attitudes towards women’s education. But, this increased educational attainment doesn’t necessarily translate into professional opportunities. Despite their higher levels of academic success, women often face structural barriers that limit their career advancement. This disconnect between educational achievement and professional progress underscores the ongoing impact of gender on career progression, pointing to the presence of systemic issues like racial biases, and unequal opportunities in the workforce.\nIn terms of professional progress, the data on occupational segregation clearly shows how gender shapes it. Certain fields remain heavily male-dominated, particularly those involving technical expertise and high-stakes decision-making roles. This indicates gender imbalance, showing historical trends where men occupy roles that are perceived as requiring greater skill or responsibility. On the other hand, women are predominantly found in roles characterized as supportive or lower-wage positions, such as secretarial work, cleaning, and assistant roles. The data also reveals that women disproportionately shoulder the burden of unpaid care responsibilities across the globe, which hinders their ability to engage in professional endeavors. In terms of comfort and safety, women, on average, report feeling less comfortable and safe at work compared to their male counterparts. In terms of Leadership, despite a slight upward trend, women remain significantly underrepresented in leadership roles such as CEOs and senators. Finally, the significant wage gap is also evidence of the gender inequality in professional opportunities, and undervaluation of women’s contributions.\nIn essence, it is crucial to make progress to ensure that women are respected and valued for their contributions in both professional and educational settings."
